              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
              heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
              warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
              would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
              for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
              the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
              realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over.

              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe

              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a

              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot

                    <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong>
                    is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the
                    Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about
                    92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                    Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old
                    enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
                    side of the universe to the other, and there has not been
                    enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix
                    into an even temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine
                    using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a
                    coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate
                    its temperature and how much it has cooled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look
                    a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup,
                    at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if
                    you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to
                    look for another explanation.

                    <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been
                    enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before
                    they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow
                    filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that
                    might explain their even temperature.

                  <p>
                    <strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory
                    proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the
                    Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of
                    light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field
                    eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                    universe.

                  <p>
                    <strong>FLUCTUATION </strong>Astronomers have now detected
                    evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
                    polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is
                    energy left over from the early universe. These are
                    gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine
                    a single, central pot expanding faster than light and
                    cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is
                    something like inflation. And the structure of the universe
                    mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

              with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
              that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
              discoveries in the history of science.”
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor
              and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
              pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
              beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to
              inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the
              cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would
              eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about
              inflation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
              need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded
              earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
              background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and
              other assumptions about the universe.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
              Krauss said.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
              will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other
              teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops
              and space.

              ‘Spirals in the Sky’
            </h4>

            <p class="text-content">
              Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
              the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
              Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
              Nobel Prize.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
              waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
              series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South
              Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions.
              The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
              Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
              Stanford.

            <p class="text-content">
              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be
              on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he
              said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
              said.

              The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the
              faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe
              being wrenched violently apart at its birth. <br />

              In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
              radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
              preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
              gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in
              one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
              twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
              said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
              little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
              differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
              telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
              thermometer.

              The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they
              spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making
              sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
              beat them to the breakthrough.

              ‘A Special Time’
            </h4>
            <p class="text-content">
              The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
              like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years
              ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
              universe.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
              gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But
              they have long suspected that those are simply different
              manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
              in its earliest, hottest moments.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
              from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers
              falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
              force after another splitting away.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
              temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at
              which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
              Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
              state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
              with a mysterious latent energy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as
              a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up.
              Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
              space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
              least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
              primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
              cosmic eye-blink.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into
              ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was
              still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of
              sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said
              that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to
              say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
              from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once
              started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
              comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
              blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known
              as the multiverse.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do
              not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
              beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before
              it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
              swept away, forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
              “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
              Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you
              wind up at inflation.”
